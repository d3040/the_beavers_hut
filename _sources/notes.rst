* Together, we face the fundamental problems of our time. Access to information. Access to education. And access to the
  tools that are shaping the future. [#]_

* Stuck in Tutorial Hell
  "If you work for 10 years, do you get 10 years of experience or do you get 1 year of experience 10 times? You have to reflect on your activities to get true experience. If you make learning a continuous commitment, you’ll get experience. If you don’t, you won’t, no matter how many years you have under your belt." – Steve McConnell, Software Engineer

* Tutorial hell is where you jump from one tutorial to the next, learning and then relearning the same basic things. But never really going beyond the fundamentals.

* Always have a project. Then learn what you need to learn en route to finishing that project.

* Why is learning to code still so hard after all these years?

There are three big reasons why learning to code is so hard, even today:

    The tools are still primitive.
    Most people aren't good at handling ambiguity, and learning to code is ambiguous. People get lost.
    Most people aren't good at handling constant negative feedback. And learning to code is one brutal error message after another. People get frustrated.

    People think software development is about typing code into a computer. But it's really about learning.

Get comfortable with ambiguity and you will go far.

How Not to Get Frustrated:
The key, again, is practice.

Tip #1: Know that you are not uniquely bad at this.
Tip #2: Breathe.
Tip #3: Use Rubber Duck Debugging

"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter." – Eric Raymond, Developer, Computer Scientist, and Author

Well, here's my theory on this: what you learn in university is less important than whether you finished university.

Employers are trying to select for people who can figure out a way to get through this rite of passage.
