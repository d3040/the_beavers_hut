# The Beaver's Hut

Welcome to the library of your thoughts. This project is about ideas and how to *efficiently* store them. After going through something called [Tutorial Hell][1], I realized that my notes ended up in notebooks, napkins, sheets of paper, digital notes, and anything else you could imagine. In other words, everywhere and anywhere. This problem took me to a journey from [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), to [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), then to [ReEstructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html), then, of course, to [Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) in [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), and finally, to **The Beaver's Hut**, my notes' personal library.

This is the result from that journey. In this repo, you will find a way to organized notes by chapters, and chapters by books. Each book is a folder containing two initial files, the index.rst and a chapter_x.rst. If another chapter is needed only create another rst file from the chapter_x.rst template, and everything is render using the [Book theme](https://sphinx-themes.org/sample-sites/sphinx-book-theme/) which I think is awesome.

Enjoy!
