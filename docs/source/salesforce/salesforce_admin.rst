Essential Habits for Salesforce Admins
--------------------------------------

1. User management
..................

- Observe your users (30 min per week).
- Review and report on adoption (60 min per week).

- Communicate with stakeholders (60 min per month).
- Create and maintain a user guide (60 min per week).

   Gather information on ``MON`` or ``TUE``, study what we have and how well we are using it on ``WED`` or ``THU``, and on ``THU`` or ``FRI`` add documentation.

2. Data management
..................

- Create and maintain backup solution (30 min per month).

  - Weekly data export.

    - Include images, documents, attachments.

- Cleanse data (time estimation depends on the project).

  - Create a custom report type (object + DUPLICATES).
  - Workflow rules, process builder, flow.

  - **Don't configure directly in production**.
  - Focus on the most important areas for your business.

- Maintain your Data Dictionary (60 min per week).

  - Data type & attributes (length)
  - API name

  - Business purpose
  - Integrations or Dependencies
  (Try the nonprofit starter pack `data dictionary template <sforce.co/NPSPDataDictionary>`_)
