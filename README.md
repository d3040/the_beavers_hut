# The Beaver's hut

Welcome, this project is about ideas and how to store them. The Beaver's hut is a library full of shelves with your books. A book is a collection of ideas organized by their origin. 

Imagine having all your notes in one place and available from anywhere. Using a simple workflow and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), you can easily take your notes using [ReEstructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) syntax (rst) and let github render your documentation site.

* Mantain your notes
* Organize your notes
* Access your notes
